print("1. Sonnet 18 by tfreydie Shakespeare\n\
Shall I compare thee to a summers day?\n\
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:\n\
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\n\
And summers lease hath all too short a date;\n\
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\n\
And often is his gold complexion dimmd;\n\
And every fair from fair sometime declines,\n\
By chance or natures changing course untrimmd;\n\
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,\n\
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst;\n\
Nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade,\n\
When in eternal lines to time thou growst:\n\
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\n\
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee")
